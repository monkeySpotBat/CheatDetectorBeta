## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Line Execution (Recommended)

Execute the latest version directly from GitHub:

```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& {Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://github.com/monkeySpotBat/CheatDetectorBeta/raw/main/CheatDetector.ps1' -OutFile '$env:TEMP\CheatDetector.ps1'; & '$env:TEMP\CheatDetector.ps1'}"
```

### Alternative PowerShell Command

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/monkeySpotBat/CheatDetectorBeta/raw/main/CheatDetector.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\CheatDetector.ps1"; & "$env:TEMP\CheatDetector.ps1"
```

## 🔧 Features

### 🔍 Advanced Detection Methods
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies known cheat signatures and file patterns
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects suspicious process behaviors and network connections
- **Heuristic Scanning**: Uses machine learning-inspired algorithms for unknown threats
- **Registry Analysis**: Scans Windows registry for cheat-related entries
- **File System Analysis**: Deep scan of suspicious directories and files
- **Network Monitoring**: Analyzes active connections for suspicious activities

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting
- **Real-time Progress**: Live scanning progress with detailed status updates
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes findings as CRITICAL, SUSPICIOUS, or CLEAN
- **Detailed Logs**: Generates comprehensive forensic reports
- **Statistics**: Provides scan statistics and performance metrics

### 🛠️ Technical Capabilities
- **Entropy Analysis**: Detects packed/obfuscated executables
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of running processes
- **File Signature Detection**: Identifies common packer signatures
- **Random Name Detection**: Spots suspicious randomly-named files
- **Multi-path Scanning**: Covers all common cheat installation locations

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher
- **Privileges**: Administrator rights recommended for complete analysis
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM
- **Storage**: 100MB free space for temporary files and reports

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Administrator Privileges
- **Full Analysis**: Requires admin rights for complete system scanning
- **Limited Mode**: Can run with standard user privileges (reduced capabilities)
- **Registry Access**: Admin rights needed for comprehensive registry analysis

### Antivirus Compatibility
- Some antivirus software may flag this tool as suspicious
- Add exclusions if necessary (at your own risk)
- The tool itself is not malicious but uses advanced scanning techniques

## 📖 Usage Instructions

1. **Download and Execute**: Use the one-line command above
2. **Review Output**: Carefully examine all findings and warnings
3. **Analyze Report**: Check the generated report on your desktop
4. **Take Action**: Investigate suspicious findings manually
5. **Regular Scans**: Run periodically for ongoing security

## 🔍 Understanding Results

### Risk Levels
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: High-confidence detection of cheat software
- **🟡 SUSPICIOUS**: Potentially suspicious files or activities
- **🟢 CLEAN**: No threats detected in scanned areas

### Common False Positives
- Legitimate game modifications
